## Questions for Future Decision

1. **Compliance Priority**: Which certifications should be prioritized first?
2. **Security Audits**: How frequently should security audits be conducted?
3. **Data Retention**: How long should user data be retained?
4. **AI Model Security**: How should user-owned models be secured?
